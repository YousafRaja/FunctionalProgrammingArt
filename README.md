# Why does this matter?
I accidently deleted this entire project about a day before it was due (this was before I appreciated the importance of version control). Within a few hours I was able to re-build it from scratch. Such a quick recovery would not have been possible with an imperative programming language that typically has many states to keep track of. 
Experience working in a purely functional programming language has had a lasting impact on how I structure my code.
